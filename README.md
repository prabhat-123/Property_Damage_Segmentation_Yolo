# Property_Damage_Segmentation_Yolo

Property_Damage_Segmentation_Yolo is a computer vision project that detects and segments property damages (cracks, corrosion-induced spalling, spalling, peeling) using YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 segmentation models. It delivers precise pixel-level damage outlines for accurate assessment.

## ✨ Features
- Automatic detection of multiple property damage types.
- Pixel-level segmentation for precise localization.
- Built on YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning framework.
- Supports YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 segmentation models.
